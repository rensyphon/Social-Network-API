# Social-Network-API

## Description

This program creates the API routes and that would go into a social media app. Once the server is started, the program is not deployed, but the routes and database can be tested in an API client, such as Insomnia. This program uses Node, Express, Mongoose, as well as the Date-Format module.

## Installation

Download the repository from [Github](), open in an IDE, and do an `npm i` in an integrated terminal to install the modules.
